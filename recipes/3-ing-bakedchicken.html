    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Recipe by Jennifer Jones</p>
        <p>An easy chicken breast recipe made with few ingredients. I use this as a basic baked chicken recipe when another recipe calls for cooked chicken. It works great for everything and is super customizable. Sometimes I use garlic salt or other seasonings, depending on what I'm using it for.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Stir together melted butter and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Brush butter mixture onto chicken until thoroughly coated, pouring any extra over chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
